# WiFi-Sensing-Privacy

## Overview
WiFi-Sensing-Privacy is a project that explores the intersection of advanced wireless signal processing and privacy concerns in modern networking environments. With routers becoming increasingly powerful, they can potentially reveal sensitive information about device usage and even the physical layout of homes. This repository delves into the capabilities of using WiFi signals for sensing human positions without the need for visual data, leveraging the DensePose technology.

## Introduction
DensePose is a technology that can map all human pixels of an RGB image to the 3D surface of the human body. Adapting this concept to WiFi signals, this project demonstrates how WiFi-based signals can be used to generate human position and pose data, offering a novel perspective on how everyday technology can intersect with privacy and security concerns.

## Project Goals
- Investigate the security implications of advanced router capabilities.
- Demonstrate the feasibility of using WiFi signals to generate human poses using DensePose.
- Provide a Python-based framework for experimenting with WiFi signal processing and human pose estimation.

## Getting Started
To get started with WiFi-Sensing-Privacy, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed, along with the necessary libraries and dependencies.
3. Review the documentation to understand the project structure and its components.
4. Run the provided example scripts to see how WiFi data can be used to generate human poses.

## Security and Privacy Considerations
This project highlights the potential for routers and other WiFi-enabled devices to inadvertently compromise user privacy. Users are encouraged to:
- Regularly update their routerâ€™s firmware to the latest version.
- Use strong, unique passwords for their network devices.
- Stay informed about the latest security and privacy practices in networked environments.
